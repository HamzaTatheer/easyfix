*Easy Fix allows you to hire workers from your home. The app will show workers from your city and selected area. *
You can also ask the worker to bring spare parts with him. Once the worker accepts your booking, you will be able to chat with him and ask further details about the work.*
The Menu makes it quite easy to select your favourite worker
and even chat with them before they reach your home.

If you like any of our worker, you can mark him as favourite and keep him in mind. You can also rate the worked you booked an appointment with. Other Than that, if you feel unsatisfied with out worker, you can complain about him to easy fix and our team will personally look into it.
